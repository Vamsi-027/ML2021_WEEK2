## Coding
- We have created frontend for  this chatbot by writing  [html](https://github.com/Vamsi-027/ML2021_WEEK2/blob/main/index.html) file. In which we have created a structure for out bot.Its a very basic html code anyone can easily understand.
- In [css](https://github.com/Vamsi-027/ML2021_WEEK2/blob/main/style.css) file we have styled your html file.
- In [JavaScript](https://github.com/Vamsi-027/ML2021_WEEK2/blob/main/script.js) ,file we have implemented the evaluate function to evaluate given expression and scroll function to scroll automatically whenever there a need to scroll down.i.e, it scrolls down automatically when user enters an expression.
